# Make My Coffee — Project Guide

## What this is
An ecommerce website selling bottled espresso shots (30ml per shot) in 4, 7, and 10-shot bottles. The brand and sole blend is called **Aconchego** — a mix of Cambodia and Indonesia beans (not single-origin; specific proportions undisclosed). The business concept is economical, DIY espresso — customers mix their own lattes, iced drinks, etc.

## Tech stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom `espresso` color palette
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State**: React Context API (CartContext) + localStorage persistence
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display (headings) + Work Sans (body) via `next/font/google`

## Running the project
```bash
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm start
```

## Pages
| Route | File | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `/` | `app/page.tsx` | Landing page — server component |
| `/shop` | `app/shop/page.tsx` | 3 product cards, add to cart |
| `/cart` | `app/cart/page.tsx` | Cart view with qty controls |
| `/order` | `app/order/page.tsx` | Checkout form + payment method picker (COD / QR) |

## Key files
- `lib/products.ts` — single source of truth for product data and the `Product` type
- `context/CartContext.tsx` — cart state, imports `Product` from `lib/products.ts`, persists to `localStorage`
- `tailwind.config.ts` — `espresso` color tokens (50–900)

## Design system
Custom color tokens all prefixed `espresso-`:
- `espresso-50/100` → cream backgrounds
- `espresso-400` → caramel gold, primary accent / CTA color
- `espresso-700/800` → mid browns
- `espresso-900` → near-black espresso, nav/footer/hero backgrounds

Headings use `style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-playfair), Georgia, serif' }}` inline (Tailwind `font-serif` is not configured separately).

## Products
Defined in `lib/products.ts` — do not duplicate elsewhere:
- **Aconchego Starter** — 4 shots / 120ml / ₱299
- **Aconchego Classic** — 7 shots / 210ml / ₱449 (Most Popular)
- **Aconchego Reserve** — 10 shots / 300ml / ₱599 (Best Value)

## Backend / payment
**No online gateway, by decision** (`memory/decision.md` D2, D13) — PayPal was planned and never built.

Checkout offers Cash on Delivery, GCash, Maya and GoTyme Bank. The wallets are
**display-only**: `/order` shows that account's QR from `public/qr/`, the customer
pays in their own app, and the order is inserted `payment_status = 'unpaid'`
regardless of method. Nothing verifies a payment — there is no merchant API for
any of the three — so an admin confirms every one by hand with Mark Paid, which
is the only thing that ever sets `paid`/`paid_at`.

`payment_method` on an unpaid order is what the customer *intends*, not what
happened. Don't read it as evidence of payment.

`lib/paymentMethods.ts` holds both method lists and the QR account table; read
its header before adding a method. QR images are in `public/qr/` (stable URLs —
the confirmation email embeds them); sources and the regeneration recipe are in
`app/assets/qr/README.md`.

## Conventions
- Orders, vouchers, shipping quotes and admin all go through `app/api/*` against Neon Postgres; only the cart is purely client-side
- Cart persists to `localStorage` under key `mmc-cart`
- Shipping: flat ₱99, free only for Pasig City orders ≥ ₱1,000 (`lib/shipping.ts`)
- Currency is PHP (`₱`), integer pesos — no cents (D1)
